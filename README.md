# week-4-Course-Project
First I downloaded the zip file from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip", then I unziped the file inf a folder I created for the course.
After using the read.table command I read the Test and Train data, each consisting of 561 observations. Also with the same command I read the feature vector and the activity labels
Then I procedeed with the merging of the data. Then extract only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, after give names to the activities in the data set.
